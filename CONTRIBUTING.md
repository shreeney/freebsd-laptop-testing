# Help us test more laptops and desktops!

The Laptop and Support Usability project is committed to ensure that FreeBSD works on [these supported configurations](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/tree/main/supported). However, we want FreeBSD to run smoothly on the systems that you use! We would appreciate any help to test and validate your desired configurations as well.

This guide provides TODO.

### Issues

For the Laptop Integration Testing Project specifically, we use Github Issues solely to triage and track open tasks that are assigned to our testers on the [project board](https://github.com/users/svmhdvn/projects/2). For this reason, issue creation in this repository is locked to Foundation staff only.

Instead, we keep Github Discussions open for you to:
* Report bugs
* Request more testing coverage
* Ask about a particular scenario
* Ask for help to get started with testing on a particular system
* Talk about anything relevant to general laptop and desktop testing

If you have anything to say, please don't hesitate to post in a Discussion! If any actionable items arise from the discussion, our staff will file an Issue for it.
